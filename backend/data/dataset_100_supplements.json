My  <span className='annotation'> symptom </span>  vanished immediately. Literally immediately (give or take 20 minutes). Maybe this was just placebo, but I do not think so.

Other times I've gotten relief from just a few capsules. While I can't be certain that this herb is acting as an antacid but I think it is a good deduction as I burp and feel a lot better after taking Valerian. Also I don't swallow the capsules but rather chew them up with water in my mouth. I do that with all capsules and tablets as I have a problem with  <span className='annotation'> dysphagia </span>  (larger food stuffs tent to get stuck in my esophagus).

Additionally, this supplement has helped me manage my mood swings and has a calming effect. Overall, I highly recommend this niacin supplement.",

            "Definitely worth buying!. Green blend is the easiest way and the fastest way to take a large quantity of green vegetables daily. Green blend is an great addition to our health as it gives a general overall boost to all aspects of our products such boosting  <span className='annotation'> immune system </span> , regulates blood pres sure,  <span className='annotation'> cholesterol </span> , balancing pH value and many others! I have tried most of the different blends by Amazing Gras s. What I like about their products is that most of it tastes very good and are very easy for beginners to start with. The price is reasonable for the bulk prices. This product contains mostly organic ingredients. The product does not use soy lecithin (cheap fillers) though they are guilty of using other cheap fillers like flax seed, apple pectin. Luckily, these are about 10% by weight only. Not that these fillers are bad, they are just les s value for money. It is best to take in morning for best absorption or when hungry (avoid unneces sary carbohydrates while loading on nutrients).For the taste, it tastes just lightly favoured chocolate. You can use les s water if you like more concentrated chocolate favour.  It also tastes good when eat straight! This product is very versatile and can be easily mix with many other powder. You can mix with lecithin (for its creamy taste), maca or other protein powder (for the sweet taste) or even Sunwarrior Ormus Supergreens (for its peppermint favour). Buy the bigger bulk to save more! Since only 40% by weight are green food, you might want to take more scoops or have an additional green blend in order to achieve the daily servings of vegetables needed.

            "Does the trick. Quite happy with this, though it is an acquired taste and doesn't mix all that easily.  To be honest, I haven't found any powders with this much goodies in it that mixes much better.\n\nThe chocolate taste is actually nice, but it is not a dessert powder by any stretch.  It has an earthy, greeny taste that is better with a creamy liquid like rice milk or soy milk than it is with plain water.\n\nI like it added to smoothies, lattes, hot chocolate or whatnot.\n\nThe main selling point here is the very noticeable alkalinizing effect it has.  The protein and herbs are nice, as is the probiotic stuff, but I would say the real thing here is being able to add a lot of green to your diet almost painlessly.\n\nI would probably even give this 4.5 stars if iHerb allowed that.  It doesn't quite deserve 5 though because I have had better products in this price range. \n\n(Note: I have no problem taking large doses of this stuff, but some people seem to have some  <span className='annotation'> digestion issues </span>  if they take too much to start with.)",

            "\"It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.\" (Mahatma Gandhi). We in Western societies are extremely well fed but very poorly nourished.  That is, we consume plenty of fat, carbohydrates and protein, but we sorely lack the micronutrients that \"real\" food provides.  Our fast food culture makes real nutrition difficult, to say the least!  Truthfully, when was the last time you ate beet root, goji berry and pomegranate?  If you're like me, the answer is NEVER.  Products like Native Reds can, at least partially, fill that void.  The ingredients list is superb, low in carbs but rich in pricey organic fruits and fiber.  For decades I have used a daily superfoods/greens drink on an empty stomach (usually Orac Energy); now I take a second serving, rotating among several different products, including Organic Red Superfood.  The taste is quite pleasant, primarily cherry with some beet in the background.  Being better hydrated confers many benefits; using a product like this to fill the nutritional gaps will provide even more: better  <span className='annotation'> skin </span> , improved  <span className='annotation'> immunity </span> , increased  <span className='annotation'> energy </span>  and so on.

Overall, I do think that it helped my intestines (success!), but the toxin release and water intake were not fun!. easy cleanse. i had to stop using this product halfway through. i believe my blood pressure shot up as a result of using it.  however, it did increase the number of my daily bowel movements.  so i know the cleansing part of the product was working.  would try again..

After some research and trying different products, I learned that typical vitamin D is made from sheep's wool and many people have negative/ <span className='annotation'> allergic reactions </span>  to this type of vitamin D.

I've been taking these Vitamin D3 supplements for a few weeks now, and will be ordering them again as they are a good quality Vitamin D3 supplement.  \r\n\r\nAs a vegan, I was keen to make sure my vitamin levels were not lacking, so I had some blood tests done at the doctors.  B12 levels were fine but I was insufficient in Vitamin D.  My doctor said this wasn't diet related but more to do with  <span className='annotation'> low sunlight levels </span>  in the Northern Hemisphere and she said that a lot of people suffer insufficient Vitamin D levels for this reason. She recommended supplementation.\r\n\r\nThese capsules are small and very easy to take, and give a good high dose of Vitamin D3, which is apparently more beneficial than Vitamin D2.  Recommended.",

After I started taking these my  <span className='annotation'> skin </span>  and  <span className='annotation'> hormones </span>  started to improve \u2013 that got really severely imbalanced after an experiment of not taking vitamin D. I sometimes even took two capsules. I also went for another check in after two months, and my doctor was surprised over my  <span className='annotation'> high levels </span> . I'll be gradually decreasing back to 2500IU now that my levels are up again :) But I'll never be without my vegan D3 during winter! \r\n\r\nIt's pretty rare to find vegan D3 at 5000IU and for such a good price point! I was worried that I'd have to go back to D3 from lanolin. But these have fixed my problems completely!",

Either way, I love this vegan D3 because the capsules are thin and normal sized, very easy to swallow -even without liquids. \r\nWill probably buy again! ",
            "Made a big difference to my health. I had the 2nd lowest level of Vit D my doctor had ever seen. After a large prescribed dose, I used these 5,000 iu capsules to help build and maintain my levels. I know they work because I forgot to take them for a while and my symptoms (worst being pain and  <span className='annotation'> fatigue </span> ) began to return. Best value vegan D3s I've found (on iHerb, at least). Definitely buying again."

To date, I have used  this product for three weeks due to   <span className='annotation'> bacterial vaginosis </span>  in conjunction with a  <span className='annotation'> UTI </span>  (both infections being E. coli mixed with enterococcus) that plagued me for over a month, and responded poorly to antibiotics. It took a while to kick in, and for about two weeks, I had some side effects from the die-off such as  <span className='annotation'> bloating </span>  and discomfort. I also added a botanical protocol- only three days ago- consisting of Cryptolepis, Sida cordifolia, Juniper, Bidens, and Cornsilk, to be taken 4 times a day . That said, I definitely felt the difference when the Renew Life Vaginal Probiotic kicked in - digestion is functioning more smoothly, and the pain lessened. I used another product with 30 Bill Probiotics and a somewhat different composition of the Lacto- and Bifidobacilli, and I can say I much prefer the Renew Life product. Will continue to take for a long time, possibly for the foreseeable future, as I consider probiotics a must for the maintenance of good health, and in my experience, low-count probiotics( 2 Billion etc.) are a waste of money.",

        "description": "Uristatin soothes the bladder and other urinary tract tissues. It helps maintain a healthy balance of microorganisms and prevents unwanted bacteria from attaching to the bladder and urethra walls. Maintaining good urinary tract health is important for women and men. Achieving this can be especially challenging for men as they age and for women post-menopause. Whereas normally healthy mucus membranes in the vagina and the urinary tract would help in this regard, in post-menopausal women the mucus membranes in the vaginal and urinary tracts can become thin and dry, which makes it more difficult to maintain good urinary tract health. In addition to drinking plenty of water and unsweetened cranberry juice, supplementing with certain botanicals can promote a healthy urinary tract. The four botanical ingredients in Uristatin \u2013 uva ursi, buchu, Echinacea, and berberine \u2013 help maintain normal urinary tract flora, soothe irritated tissues in the bladder and other areas of the urinary tract, and prevent unwanted bacteria from attaching to the walls of the bladder and urethra. A study on uva ursi, one of the four botanical ingredients in Uristatin, found that after one year, all 30 women in the uva ursi group had maintained a healthy urinary tract. Buchu can help soothe inflamed tissues, while Echinacea and berberine provide additional beneficial effects. A good strategy to maintain urinary tract health is to drink plenty of pure water every day. Unsweetened cranberry juice or a cranberry extract in capsule form can also be taken as needed to acidify the urine. When supplementing with Uristatin, however, cranberry juice or cranberry extract should be discontinued because uva ursi and berberine work best in alkaline urine.",

Bathing your teeth in sugar overnight is the worst thing you can do for them..\r\nAnyhow, I haven't noticed any improvement in my quality of  <span className='annotation'> sleep </span> , I still wake several times a night. The only difference I can note is that it does seem to make me  <span className='annotation'> drowsy </span>  after I take it, which helps with getting to  <span className='annotation'> sleep </span>  initially.

Now when i get to write my own review on this multivitamin, I have to say it is very difficult to describe what it does without talking about it in terms of \"feelings\". This is not medicine, of course it is not intended to treat a particular condition, but i do \"feel\" a difference in terms of my  <span className='annotation'> energy </span>  level on a consistent basis. I feel more awake and alive during the day, keeping all other daily routines constant. I also feel that my  <span className='annotation'> hair </span>  has softened and improved quite a bit, not sure if it is due to the supplement or the shampoos i use (check out my reviews to see which shampoos i use). I feel better after taking this supplement. I know it sounds very vague, but I think \"feeling better\" is exactly what this multivitamin intends to do. The tablet is quite big, but I still like it for the convenience it offers. More nutrients are packed in the pill compared with other brands of multivitamins I looked at on iherb.

Pepsin is protrease produced in the stomach that partially breaks down protein in foods. HCL production tends to decline with age, so supplementing with HCL and pepsin may help to maintain normal digestive function.

I had been using the equivalent Great Lakes product for a while, then all the health bloggers I follow started touting this brand as being superior for reasons I can no longer remember... Is it better than Great Lakes? In terms of effectiveness, I don't notice a difference. Since using collagen peptides of either brand, my  <span className='annotation'> hair </span>  and  <span className='annotation'> nails </span>  grow more quickly, and my  <span className='annotation'> knees </span>  are more 'cracky' when I don't use it. I'm also finally overcoming a bout of adult  <span className='annotation'> acne </span> , but it's hard to say whether the collagen has helped, since I'm doing and taking so many other things for my  <span className='annotation'> skin </span> !\nThe one difference I do notice with the Vital Proteins brand is that it dissolves more easily in my tea than Great Lakes. Sometimes the Great Lakes just sits in a pile on the top of my tea, and when I stir it in I get a few clumpy bits. That never happens with the Vital Proteins.\nI do find that both brands noticeably alter the taste of my tea, so I add honey to mask it.\nSince it's so much more expensive than Great Lakes, and I can't be sure it's superior, I alternate buying the two brands to save a little money.",

As a  <span className='annotation'> breast cancer </span>  survivor, I try to avoid preservatives and whey/soy products as much as possible. Previously, I used egg-white protein powder as a source of extra protein, but I think this product is even better. I like the flexibility it provides and since it has no taste,  it can basically be mixed in anything. I frequently mix it with applesauce or yogurt but it is just as easy to add it to juice or some other beverage [No blender needed]. The fact that it is a natural product without additives is a big plus for me. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it on a routine basis. ",

Tried many other products from chemist but no help. The reason I started was to relieve my bad  <span className='annotation'> heartburn </span> . I started in April 2018 for the  <span className='annotation'> heartburn </span> ,  takes only fifteen minutes and the burning is gone. I use the cooking measuring spoon,  not the spoon that comes with the container. I am Asian so I am very small in build so I only use 1/2 teaspoon of cooking measuring spoon in the morning after breakfast and 1/2 teaspoon after dinner, in one glass of plain tap water, every day. I use to take 1 teaspoon, but I felt very tired and  <span className='annotation'> sleepy </span>  that's why I cut down 1/2 teaspoon twice a day. It is now early September 2018. I don't have anymore  <span className='annotation'> heartburn </span>  and on top of that my  <span className='annotation'> hair </span>  is starting to grow back slowly with baby fine  <span className='annotation'> hair </span> . Also I have noticed a little more youthful appearance on my face, not too drastic in improvements as the product claims, but I am happy with the slight increase in youthful look, for someone who is 45 years old. I have about half a container left of the 567g container. It lasts a while. It doesn't give me  <span className='annotation'> energy </span>  as some claim but then again I am only taking a small dose a day. I recommend it to a lot of people.

            "Amazing. This is the best casein supplement you can buy in my opinion. You get the BCAA\u2019s you need as well. A good majority of your  <span className='annotation'>  <span className='annotation'> muscle </span>  growth </span>  comes in the first hours of REM  <span className='annotation'> sleep </span> , When you don\u2019t eat over an eight hour or so. At night your body starts to burn off  <span className='annotation'> muscle </span> . This combined with other simple supplements a low-calorie diet and 30 min excercise a day will get you the fastest and most lasting results. For those of you complaining about the chunkiness or they\u2019re being clumps in it not dissolving it\u2019s because you\u2019re not mixing it correctly. This should be the last thing you take before you go to  <span className='annotation'> sleep </span> , To as a suggestion about 20 minutes before you go to  <span className='annotation'> sleep </span>  to a half an hour mix your drink and a shaker shake it up pretty well let it sit for about 20 minutes shake it again and drink it right before you go to bed and you will have no clumps.\n",
            "Best price per gram of protein, very convenient to include in diet and tasty when mixed with milk. Waited weeks for this to get back on stock and just 2 days after it was back it ran out and I had bought the last piece.\nI love how it contains purely protein, 30 grams 28 of which is casein. It tastes amazing like a milk shake (pun) with milk before bed, horrible mixed with water as it feels like I am drinking soap in the end due to how bubbly it gets, I just add 1 scoop and 300 ml of milk before bed and I'm good to go, or on rest days where it's hard to find protein I would use two scoops, one in the morning one at night or two at night with 600 ml of milk.\nAll casein in general can be really helpful to avoid entering a catabolic mode when  <span className='annotation'> sleeping </span>  or to simply prolong  <span className='annotation'> anabolism </span>  and  <span className='annotation'> protein synthesis </span> , whey to be taken immediately after, possibly immediately before or during workout as it is digested fairly quickly within an hour, while taking this before bed as casein digests really slowly up to 7 hours to maintain  <span className='annotation'> protein synthesis </span>  and  <span className='annotation'> muscle building </span> . It is also a guaranteed 250+ calories before the end of the day to make it easier to stick to a clean and  <span className='annotation'> lean bulking </span>  diet.\nWhat made me buy this over any other protein is the price especially after the 30% discount from november (possibly before) all the way till the end of the year. Its pricing competes with whey protein and is even cheaper than many whey proteins, it is half the price (per gram of protein) compared to other casein proteins out there if you include the 30% discount.\nOverall an excellent choice from me. Considering buying again before discount ends, but not sure if I should.",
            "No Effect on me. I don't notice any changes in the 10 months I drink protein shakes.\nI work out everyday a little . 100 push ups, 100 crunches, 100 abs wheel moves, 100 squats. Nothing too time consuming and my body shape is not bad in general, but I wanted to add a bit more  <span className='annotation'> muscle </span>  without put more effort and  time on it.\n\nI use this casein protein before going to bed and the whey protein right after workout. Both mixed with milk and matcha powder not with water, and I drink it everyday.\nYet nothing.\n\nI guess it's mainly up to Our genetics not those drinks and pills. But probably for athletes and those guys go everyday twice to gym it must be helpful. \n\nIf You are like me, try it 1-2 months, see if it works. If no visible gain as me.....save Your money. ",

I didn't read all the info on the  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>   <span className='annotation'> detox </span>  yet because that comes later and it is a lot of info.\r\nSo first a did the Now Foods Bowel Cleanse, which worked well, I lost the  <span className='annotation'> bloating </span>  tummy and felt much better.\r\nThen I went to phase II:  <span className='annotation'> liver cleanse </span>  and  <span className='annotation'> liver support </span> . \r\nHere, Alpha Lipoic Acid is one of the many recommended products.\r\nI took one cap every day,\r\nAnd I started to feel so awful after a couple of day... It was like the first y <span className='annotation'> ears </span>  of my  <span className='annotation'>  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>  intoxication </span>  period, right after my new silver fillings had been placed. I felt awful,  <span className='annotation'> nauseous </span> , severe  <span className='annotation'> intestinal pains </span> , weakness,  <span className='annotation'> mind fog </span> , outraged, crying and shouting at everyone, crippled, not knowing what to do and where to go,  <span className='annotation'> panick </span>  attacks. My  <span className='annotation'> blood pressure </span>  raise. My  <span className='annotation'> ears </span>  started ringing. I couldn't  <span className='annotation'> sleep </span>  no more.\r\n\r\nI had to keep my mind clear and try to find out what was going on.\r\n\r\nI went through some files on my computer already prepared for the  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>   <span className='annotation'> detox </span>  in the future I was planning.\r\nThere I found many, many warnings: do not use ALA in high doses and unprepared. ALA must be taken in very small doses to start with (from 1 mg to 12 mg!) and because of it's half life, you have to take it every 3 hours, not one minute later. \"Taking it less often means running a higher risk of regression or damage. Taking large single doses or once a day doses can result in permanent neurological and other damage. Challenge tests are an example of this kind of usage.\" This is because ALA (= Alpha Lipoic Acid) is the only  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>  chelator that can go to the brain and bind the  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>  sitting there. It then goes back to the blood and after 3 hrs, it's half life, it releases the  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span> , which then goes to anywhere it wants, but mainly the kidney, liver and  <span className='annotation'> intestines </span> .\r\nLuckily I had stopped after 4 days of 600 mg of ALA. To start to feel normal took one more week. Well, normal, I am still thrown back in a state where I was y <span className='annotation'> ears </span>  ago, before starting supplementing.\r\nPositive side: I know now for sure that I have  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>  in my brain and lots of it. Other positive thing: this was a wake-up call for me and I will start the Andy Cutler protocol asap (find it on the web), a protocol followed by thousands of  <span className='annotation'> heavy metal intoxicated </span>  persons.\r\nSo when you buy this product, make sure you have first read about ALA and  <span className='annotation'> mercury </span>   <span className='annotation'> detox </span> , and take the 600 mg as a single dose ONLY IF you are absolutely sure that you have absolutely no  <span className='annotation'> heavy metals in your brain </span> .",

After constant injuries, weak and  <span className='annotation'> tight muscles </span>  throughout my entire body,  <span className='annotation'> sore achilles </span> / <span className='annotation'> tight lower calves </span>  since my teens, the beginnings of  <span className='annotation'> carpal tunnel </span> ,  <span className='annotation'> tingling arms and aching hamstrings </span> /legs, <span className='annotation'> itchy skin </span> , extreme  <span className='annotation'> fatigue </span> ,  <span className='annotation'> blurry vision problems </span>  and just frustrating disconnects/slowness in my  <span className='annotation'> mental concentration </span> , I finally worked out through constant personal research, that although my B12 levels were in the 'normal' range that I was actually moderately deficient.  I slowly titrated up to 1mg (after quite noticeable start up symptoms), and then carried on up to 5mg a day.  I'm taking these with Metafolin (methylfolate), prescribed iron tablets (tested severely deficient) and the other active B12, dibencozide (adenosylcobalamin).  Best I've felt in a long, long time!

            "Dislike the mannitol and sorbitol - going to try California Xtracts or Jarrow Formulas. Note: high doses of B12 may deplete iodine, iron, zinc, manganese. 1) Pure Advantage methyl-B12 spray - ineffective (I wonder about the sorbate preservative in it); 2) InterPlexus Inc NutriSorb liquid hydroxycobalamin - effective but still needs to be 'converted' to active form - I found the one drop dose suggested on label isn't enough; 3) Solgar cyanocobalamin 1mg sublingual - dissolves too fast and not as effective as active methyl-B12; 4) Natural Factors methyl-B12 1mg sublingual - dissolves too fast under tongue but found it better inbetween  <span className='annotation'> gum/lip </span>  where it will sit and dissolve more slowly. Iodine/B12 are synergists - suggest adding/increasing either one if taking more of the other, especially long term. Same is true of other nutrients such as manganese and zinc (both need cobalt, high cobalt may deplete them) - could be why some people note headaches after taking high doses of B12 (both high and low manganese can cause  <span className='annotation'> migraine-headaches </span> ). High doses of B12 will also deplete iron - they are antagonists. If this review was helpful to you, please click YES below - thank you.

            "Great Product For A Fussy  <span className='annotation'> 8mo </span> . My baby was  <span className='annotation'> 8mo </span>  when I started giving her this. She is very sensitive and would reject almost anything and everything that is not organic or natural. She would spit it out or refuses to eat it if it smells funny, and she seem to be able to tell if some fruits/food are not organic and refuses to take it. Hence It was hard to find the right teething gel for her, given her  <span className='annotation'> fussiness </span> . Thankfully this works like a charm and she accepts it, she seems to know it helps calm her  <span className='annotation'> teething discomfort </span> , and would point to the box before bedtime. At 12 months she\u2019s still taking this and have rejected other teething gels along the way. Highly recommend this to young fussy babies.",
